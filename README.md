Exercise: Building a Task Management API

Scenario: You are tasked with creating a mobile-first, responsive one-page website that features an image gallery. The images for the gallery will be fetched from a public API, and the website should have a navigation bar with at least three menu points.

Requirements:
1. Set up a new HTML5 project with a responsive design approach (mobile-first) using appropriate meta tags.
2. Implement a navigation bar with a hamburger menu for mobile devices and a full menu for larger screens. Include at least three menu points (e.g., Home, Gallery, Contact).
3. Use CSS (preferably SCSS) for styling, focusing on creating a clean and visually appealing design.
4. Implement an API call to fetch a list of images for the gallery. You can use a placeholder API or a public image service.
5. Display the fetched images in a responsive image gallery format on the webpage.
6. Ensure that the website is accessible and adheres to best practices for responsive design.
7. Implement smooth transitions or animations for a better user experience.
8. Include a footer section with relevant information (e.g., copyright, contact details).
9. Symfony knowledge/usage is a plus.
